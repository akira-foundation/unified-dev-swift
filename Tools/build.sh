# When this bundle was assembled, which is the only thing that tells two development builds apart.

# A release has a version and a build number. A build made here has neither: BuildIdentity prints
# "Development build" for it, plus the commit for the copy Tools/master.sh installs, so two builds
# made an hour apart from the same commit print the same line, and there are usually several of
# them on this machine at once. The About window now adds this date for those cases and ignores it
# for a release, where it would describe the release runner rather than anything the reader has.
#
# Stamped here rather than measured at runtime from the executable's modification date, because an
# mtime moves when a bundle is copied and codesign rewrites the binary below, so that number would
# be an approximation in the shape of a fact. That is the same mistake as reading the placeholder
# version out of Resources/Info.plist, one level down. Written on every build, release included,
# because what the About window does with it is the window's decision and not this script's.

# stays in Resources/Info.plist, where a fallback should live, and only the four digit year in it
# is replaced with the year this bundle was assembled. A build made some other way ships the

# macOS 26 draws an app icon from a layered Icon Composer document rather than from a flat bitmap:
# the glass, the shadow and the specular pass belong to the system and are applied live to the
# layers. Resources/UnifiedDev.icon is that document. actool compiles it into an Assets.car, which the
# system finds through CFBundleIconName in Info.plist. It is now the only icon in the bundle: the
# floor is macOS 26 and there is no system left that would draw a flat one. Tools/icon/layers.py
# writes it.
#
# Resources/Assets.xcassets goes into the same catalogue and the same invocation, because a second
# actool run compiling to the same directory writes a second Assets.car over the first and the app
# loses whichever went in first. One run, two inputs, one file with both in it. What is in the
# catalogue besides the icon is the AccentColor set NSAccentColorName names, which is what the whole
# window draws in when the system accent is Multicolor.
#
# Command line tools on their own carry no actool, so a machine with only those produces a bundle
# with no icon at all, and no accent set either: on Multicolor the app then draws in the system's
# default blue. That is loud enough to notice and cheaper than failing the build.
