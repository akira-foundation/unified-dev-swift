            Ask a workspace's own agent to merge its pull request.

            This does not merge anything. It composes the request Unified Dev's own Merge button \
            composes, with the project's merge instructions attached, and sends it into that \
            workspace's chat as an ordinary message. The agent runs `gh pr merge` there, in front \
            of the owner, under whatever permission mode they set, and can say what GitHub \
            answered if it refuses.

            So it returns once the turn has begun, and the merging happens inside that turn, after \
            this call is over. Nothing has landed on GitHub when this answers, and the merge may \
            still not happen. Do not report a pull request as merged on the strength of this call. \
            Call workspace_list with include_github afterwards and read the state.

            It refuses a pull request GitHub will not take, a worktree holding work GitHub has not \
            got, and a workspace whose agent is busy. When it refuses, do not run `gh pr merge` \
            yourself and do not ask another agent to. Merging publishes to a server other people \
            share, and Unified Dev only does it where the owner can watch it happen.

            Name the workspace by the id workspace_list reports, not by its name. It squash merges \
            unless you say otherwise.
