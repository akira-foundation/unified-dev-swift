            Suggest a piece of work to the owner instead of starting it. Unified Dev puts a card in \
            this chat, below your message, with your title, your reason and the whole prompt, and \
            the owner decides with one click whether it starts and where: as a new workspace of its \
            own, or here, as a subagent of this chat. Nothing starts until the owner presses a button.

            Use it for work you found outside what you were asked to do: a defect in another part \
            of the code, a fix that belongs in another repository, a follow-up that deserves its \
            own pull request. Call workspace_start or agent_start yourself only when the owner has \
            asked you to start the work.

            'title' names the work in a few words. 'why' is one sentence saying why you are \
            suggesting it now. 'prompt' is everything the agent that does it gets: it cannot see \
            this conversation, so write it as if to somebody who has just opened the project, and \
            say what finished looks like.

            'project' is optional. Leave it out for the project this chat is in. Otherwise name a \
            project Unified Dev has, by its name or its path; give the absolute path of a repository \
            on this Mac that is not in Unified Dev yet; or give owner/repository for one that is only \
            on GitHub. The card says which, and one that is only on GitHub cannot be started from \
            the card yet.

            A workspace holds \(WorkSuggestion.undecidedLimit) suggestions waiting for the owner at \
            once. It answers at once with the suggestion's id: keep it, because work_withdraw takes \
            it if the suggestion stops making sense. Do not wait for the owner's decision: carry on \
            with your own work.
