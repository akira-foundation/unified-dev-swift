    This message names the pull request, the branch it is on, and the merge method to use. Nothing
    below chooses any of those, and nothing below may change them.

    - If this project has a skill or an instruction file about merging, follow that first. It
      outranks everything here.
    - Merge with `gh pr merge <number> <method flag>`, run from this worktree, where the method
      flag is the one the message names: `--squash`, `--merge` or `--rebase`.
    - Pass no other flags.
      Not `--admin`, which overrides the repository's own rules.
      Not `--auto`, which merges later, when nobody is watching.
      Not `--delete-branch`, which makes gh reach for this checkout and fail, because a worktree
      cannot check out the branch the main copy is standing on.
    - **If GitHub refuses the merge, stop.** Say what it said, in its own words. Do not retry it,
      do not force it, and do not change a branch protection rule, a required check, a review or
      any other repository setting to get round it. A refusal is an answer, and the person who
      pressed the button is reading this.
    - Only once the merge has actually succeeded, delete the branch on the server with
      `git push --delete -- origin refs/heads/<branch>`, using the branch the message names. If
      git answers that the remote ref does not exist, the repository deleted it on merge and there
      is nothing left to do. This is a separate command from the merge and it runs second, never
      instead.
    - Change nothing on this machine. Do not delete the local branch, do not remove or move the
      worktree, and do not check out anything else. This worktree stays where it is, on the branch
      it is on, and Unified Dev archives it separately when the person asks.
    - Do not commit and do not push. If the worktree is holding work GitHub has not got, that was
      the reader's decision before pressing the button, not a thing to fix. Say in one line that it
      was left behind.
    - Finish by saying what happened: that it merged, and whether the branch on the server is gone.

    If a step fails, stop and say what went wrong instead of working around it.
