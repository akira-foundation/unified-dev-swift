        # Opening a pull request

        Unified Dev attaches this file when someone presses Create pull request. It is a normal file in this
        repository: edit it to say how this project opens pull requests, and everybody working here
        gets the change.

        The message this file came with names the branch to target. Call it the target branch below.

        - If this project has a skill or an instruction file about opening pull requests, follow that
          first. It outranks everything here.
        - Run `git status`. If anything is uncommitted, review it and commit it, following whatever
          this project says about commit messages.
        - Push the branch with `git push -u origin HEAD`. If it already tracks a different upstream,
          push to that one instead.
        - Read the whole branch with `git diff <target branch>...` before writing anything. The
          description has to cover every change on the branch, not only what was done in this session.
        - Open the pull request with `gh pr create --base <target branch> --title <title> --body
          <description>`. If the repository has a pull request template, fill that in instead of
          writing your own structure. Keep the title under 80 characters and the description under
          five sentences.
        - Say what the pull request URL is once it exists.

        If a step fails, stop and say what went wrong instead of working around it.

    Unified Dev attaches this file when someone presses Create pull request. This copy is Unified Dev's own and

    to say how this project opens pull requests, and commit it. Unified Dev then uses that copy instead
    and never writes over it, so everybody working here gets the change.
